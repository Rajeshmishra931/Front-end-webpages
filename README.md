# Front-end-webpages
There are three front end webages in this repository.
1> GOTHAM - A copy of a news website 
2> ExotiCar - A copy of a car website 
3> Project Cat - practiced how to make the webpage responsive to the size of the user screen
4>Let's Travel - A copy of travel website
All this I made during the UDEMY COURSE OF "The Result Oriented Web Development".
